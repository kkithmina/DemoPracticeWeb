 <h1>What is the purpose?</h1>
 <p>While there are 200+ comedians who are actively creating content for the 10 million Sri Lankan nternet users, I saw  
    creative gap in absurd yet intellectual comedy. I started my journey with dubbed content while being inspired by creators 
    like Key & Peele, Mr. Beast, Rudsssy Mancuso, and PewDiePie.<br><br>

    <h1>How did it grow?</h1>
    <p>Simply put, it grew because my content was unique and I published regularly. I started using on-the-edge <br> sinhalese phrases to mock social awkwardnes and it was welcomed while my channels grew exponentially.<br> Here are the strategies that I used to grow this fast. </p>
