 <h1>What is the purpose?</h1>
 <p>While there are 200+ comedians who are actively creating content for the 10 million Sri Lankan nternet users, I saw  
    creative gap in absurd yet intellectual comedy. I started my journey with dubbed content while being inspired by creators 
    like Key & Peele, Mr. Beast, Rudsssy Mancuso, and PewDiePie.<br><br>

<<<<<<< HEAD
    ​I drew inspiration from their purposes. For an example, Key & Peele mocks gender and ethnic stereotypes and social 
    awkwardness while Mr. Beast is a viral philanthropist. I combined their individual purposes and adopted them into my 
    brand.<br><br> 
    
    ​Therefore, the purpose of Pissu Kanna is to ignite conversations by mocking stereotypes and social awkwardness while the 
    gains are used for philanthropic purposes. The virality is just a by-product of this overall purpose.<br></p>

    <h1>How did it grow?</h1>
    <p>Simply put, it grew because my content was unique and I published regularly. I started using on-the-edge <br> sinhalese phrases to mock social awkwardnes and it was welcomed while my channels grew exponentially.<br> Here are the strategies that I used to grow this fast. </p>
